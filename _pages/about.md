I am currently an undergradute studying AI science at Peking University. My interets lie in machine learning, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, etc. I have conducted several small research projects and developed some toy applications. It is my enthusiasm to find way to teach AI about human values so that it can be applied to practical domains efficently and safely.

This site, as its title implies, is a semi-secret reserve for myself. There aren't meant to be fancy decorations or some 'brilliant' insignts and cutting-edge expertise. Rather, I 'd like to share some experience and thoughts concerning not only AI, but also games, films and literature.

If you are fascinated about magical realism literature, cult films, visual novels, strategy games, Medieval history, dream pop, classics(so on, I can do this whole day)...

feel free to share your ideas with me!
