Oftentime CSAI students are driven crazy by nasty environments building process, which is a must for conducting research. Packages dependencies? Version conficts? Operating system inconsistency? Network failures? Environments can crash ***1000*** times...

I am going to deliver lessons learned through blood and tears during the following paragraphs. Hope this will be useful to you.

## First-of-all tips
* Use [Conda](https://docs.conda.org.cn/) to manage your virtual environment. 
* Check the consistency between packages and your OS. DO NOT try to install a Ubuntu-only package on your windows machine!!!
* Always refer to official documents first before you turn to StackOverflow or likewise forums. Be cautious with CSDN or never use it at all.

## A simple Conda guide

### Install you preferable Conda distribution

The two mainstream versions of **Conda** are [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). **Miniconda** is a minimal installer for **Conda**. It is a small, bootstrap version of **Anaconda** that includes only **Conda**, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, such as pip and zlib. **Anaconda**, on the other hand, includes a large number of pre-installed packages. I myself have a preference for the former because it is lightweight, quick to install. Also it is easier for you to customize(since it has barely anything at start) and avoid potential conflicts or bloat. So I will use **Miniconda** as an example.

Open a terminal or command prompt(Here choose your favaorite shell, I prefer bash.). Download the **Miniconda** installer for your operating system:

Linux/macOS
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Windows

```bash
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe
```

Run the installer:

Linux/macOS
```bash
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Windows

```bash
start Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe
```

After installation, initialize **Miniconda**. This step is IMPORTANT, DO NOT close the terminal without it.

```bash
conda init
```

Restart your terminal or command prompt for changes to take effect.

### Configure initial settings for conda

To Update **Conda**, run:

```bash
conda update conda
```

Add default channels for package management:

```bash
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Other channels include *Pytorch*, *nvidia* etc. You should definitely check which channel your desired package is. Use ```-c``` option to name channel when installing packages. Use ```conda config --show channels``` to list your channels. Use ```conda config --remove channels <channel_name>``` to remove channels.

### Create a virtual environment

Finally we are here!

To create a new environment, run:

```bash
conda create --name myenv
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

Deactivate the environment:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

### Manage your packages

```bash
conda install <package_name> -c <channel_name>
```

When you name the certain version of packages or python, use ```==``` followed by version number. You'd better look up the versions in official documents, e.g., go to [pytorch](pytorch.org) to check the version number that is consistent with your OS and cuda version.

Or you can also use ```pip``` to install packages. 

```bash
pip install <package_name>
```

Use ```pip install``` or ```conda install``` ? Well, that depends. Generally speaking, the number of packages available in **Conda** is relatively small, especially for newer or niche packages that may not be in the **Conda** repositories. So one may have to use ```pip install``` sometimes for package like *mplib*, *toppra*, etc. 

**Pip** has extensive package availability, fast updates and high flexibility, however, **pip** primarily manages Python packages and has limited capabilities for managing non-Python dependencies (such as C libraries). Also, **pip**'s dependency resolver is not as powerful as **Conda**'s, potentially leading to dependency conflicts.

Another important technique to resolve dependencies conflicts is to remove the previous versions and install new ones. In this case, you only need to run ```conda install <package_name>==<new_version_number>```, **Conda** will automataly remove the previous version for you.

Sometimes build process crashes, we might want to clear it all and start all over again. Run 

```bash
conda remove <package_name> # remove a package
conda remove --name myenv --all # delete a environment
```

Cleaning the cache is helpful, too. Run

```bash
conda clean --packages
conda clean --index-cache
conda clean --lock
conda clean --logfiles
conda clean --all
```

### Mirror sources

Using mirror sources can significantly speed up the download of packages and libraries, especially in situations where network connectivity is slow or access to official sources is restricted. 

Open your terminal or command prompt. Edit the Conda configuration file (usually ```~/.condarc```):

```bash
conda config --set show_channel_urls yes
```

Add commonly used domestic mirror sources (such as Tsinghua, USTC, etc.):

```bash
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/main/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/free/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/conda-forge/
```

Set the default mirror source:

```bash
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

For **pip**, the process is similar

```bash
pip install numpy -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple # Specify a mirror source temporarily
```

Edit the pip configuration file (usually ```~/.pip/pip.conf```):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pip
echo "[global]" >> ~/.pip/pip.conf
echo "index-url = https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple" >> ~/.pip/pip.conf
```

### Trouble shooting

* Keep your ```base``` environment clean and small-size. You are advised not to make big changes to it and back it up.
* If you have trouble installing using ```conda install``` or ```pip install```, you can try to clone git repository into your working directory, and run ```setup.py``` to build the packages.
* A Linux virtual machine can solve multiple system consistency problems.
